# Collaboration Work:

## A Group Sequential Clinical Trial Design for Reducing Surgical Site Infections With Tumescent Anesthesia Antibiotic Delivery
+ The use of tumescent anesthesia antibiotic delivery (TAAD) is predicted to reduce the rate of surgical site infection (SSI) 
compared with intravenous antibiotic delivery (IVAD), in particular
for patients receiving emergency gastrointestinal surgery. 
I helped determine necessary sample sizes for a group sequential clinical trial to compare treatment of TAAD+IVAD to 
the currently used IVAD only treatment.
