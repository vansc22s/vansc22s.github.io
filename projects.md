# Collaboration Work:

## A Group Sequential Clinical Trial Design for Reducing Surgical Site Infections With Tumescent Anesthesia Antibiotic Delivery
+ The use of tumescent anesthesia antibiotic delivery (TAAD) is predicted to reduce the rate of surgical site infection (SSI) 
compared with intravenous antibiotic delivery (IVAD), in particular
for patients receiving emergency gastrointestinal surgery. 
I helped determine necessary sample sizes for a group sequential clinical trial to compare treatment of TAAD+IVAD to 
the currently used IVAD only treatment.
+ Analysis was prepared for this group sequential trial September 2017 - June 2018 for Dr. Jeffrey Klein MD, under the direction of [Dr. Daniel Jeske PhD](https://www.danielrjeske.com) 

## Gene Clustering for Mice with Chronic and Nonchronic Wounds

+ To identify genes which are influential for wound healing, I began work to identify which genes have different behavior in chronic and non-chronic wounds. This knowledge could be crucial to understanding what is preventing wound-healing in mice with chronic wounds. My work
involved clustering genes with similar behavior for these two groups over time and identifying which genes showed statistically significant difference in counts for chronic and non-chronic mice, significant difference over time, and significant difference in behavior of the two groups over time.
+ Analysis was prepared June 2017 - September 2017 for Dr. Manuela Martins-Green PhD and her PhD student Jane Kim, under the direction of [Dr. Daniel Jeske PhD](https://www.danielrjeske.com)
