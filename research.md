## Research Project
### A Bayesian Longitudinal Analysis of Count Data With Gaussian Processes
+ Current work in differential expression analysis for RNA-seq data sets uses a negative binomial distribution to model the counts of tags for the subjects in the data. This model is functional when measurements are only taken once on these subjects, but additional correlation is introduced when the subjects are measured at multiple time points. My research aims to use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to extend this negative binomial model that will use Gaussian Processes to address the unpredictable temporal nature of the data. 
+ Work is done under the advisement of [Dr. Daniel Jeske, PhD](https://www.danielrjeske.com).
